# Our Sweet Universe

A private couple app, built incrementally as a learning project.

**Current milestone: Step 3 — private memories and couple settings.** Login and owner setup are available. `/space` supports text memories, editing, confirmed deletion, milestone stories, pagination, anniversary countdown and owner-only couple settings. `/demo` remains fictional. Shared heart photo upload, replacement, zoom/position editing and removal are implemented with authenticated Cloudinary delivery; see [heart photo setup](docs/HEART-PHOTO.md). Memory photo/video attachments, letters, jar persistence, V2 invitations and full deployment hardening are still upcoming.

## Run locally

Use Node.js 22.13+ (tested on Node 24) and pnpm 10.26.2.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000/demo. No credentials are needed for the fictional preview. It never writes to localStorage, a database, or Cloudinary. `/space` redirects to login when the app is unconfigured. Do not enter real private content into the demo.

```sh
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run lint
pnpm test
pnpm run build
```

## Read the project in this order

1. `src/app/layout.tsx` — common HTML shell and metadata.
2. `src/app/demo/[[...section]]/page.tsx` — Next.js routes to all seven preview screens.
3. `src/components/shell.tsx` — navigation and responsive layout.
4. `src/components/preview.tsx` — sample UI interactions; separate from private storage.
5. `src/lib/db/schema.ts` — Drizzle tables, foreign keys and indexes.
6. `src/lib/auth.ts` — Better Auth with Drizzle and closed public registration.
7. `src/lib/authorization.ts` — session-to-couple authorization boundary.
8. `src/lib/memories.ts` — SQL-shaped queries with couple filtering.

## Environment setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`. Keep real values out of Git and chat. `DATABASE_URL` is a Neon PostgreSQL connection string. `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` must contain at least 32 cryptographically random characters; `BETTER_AUTH_URL` is the exact app origin. Cloudinary settings stay server-side and are not needed for Step 1.

```sh
pnpm run db:generate
# Review generated SQL before applying to your development Neon branch.
pnpm run db:migrate
```

The included migration has been applied to this checkout’s configured Neon database. Fresh databases still need `pnpm run db:migrate`. Do not run migrations against production as part of casual UI testing. Public signup is deliberately disabled; run `pnpm setup:owner` locally to create the first account and couple membership. Follow [Step 2](docs/STEP-2.md) for the prompts and login check. There is no signup bypass hidden in the demo.

See [Step 3 walkthrough](docs/STEP-3.md) for the memory flow and verification limits.

## V1 delivery sequence

- [x] Step 1: architecture, seven-route UI preview, schema, auth configuration, scoped read foundation.
- [ ] Step 2: development Neon branch, migration integration checks, one-time owner provisioning, sign-in/sign-out, membership and session tests.
- [x] Step 3 implementation: private couple settings, anniversary date, text memories CRUD and Our Story milestones; input validation and database isolation checks. Browser create/edit/delete, milestone and settings-save checks passed.
- [ ] Step 4: authenticated Cloudinary upload and delivery, gallery, ownership checks and deletion cleanup.
- [ ] Step 5: private letters and jar CRUD; couple-filtered random note selection.
- [ ] Step 6: live integration tests, backups and restore, deployment hardening and private hosting.

V2 adds an expiring single-use invite for a second account, with transactional capacity enforcement, revocation and account recovery. Every V1 object already has `coupleId` and `createdBy`.

### Restricted macOS development environments

If the development watcher reports `EMFILE`, run `WATCHPACK_POLLING=true pnpm run dev`. The preview in this session was checked with polling enabled. This avoids changing system-wide file limits.
